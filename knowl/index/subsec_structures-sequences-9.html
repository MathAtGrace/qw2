<div class="para"> For example, we might consider the Fibonacci sequence <span class="process-math">\((f_n)_{n\ge 1}\text{,}\)</span> which starts <span class="process-math">\(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,\ldots\text{.}\)</span> What is the 4th term in the sequence? We might say <span class="process-math">\(f_4 = 3\)</span> (this is assuming the first 1 is the first term and not the 0th term). Note that there can only be one 4th term. There can only be one <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-th term for any particular value of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> So for any input (the position of the term), there is only one output (the term). It would be perfectly reasonable to write <span class="process-math">\(f(4) = 3\text{,}\)</span> and that really does look like a function. But we like to use subscripts.</div>
