<div class="para"> The statement about monopoly is an example of a <dfn class="terminology">tautology</dfn>, a statement that is necessarily true based on its logical form alone. Tautologies are always true, but they don’t tell us much about the world. No knowledge about monopoly was required to determine that the statement was true, and thus knowing that the statement is true tells us nothing about monopoly. It is equally true that “if the moon is made of cheese, then Elvis is still alive, or if Elvis is still alive, then unicorns have 5 legs.”</div>
