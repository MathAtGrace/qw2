<div class="para"> Anyone who doesn’t believe there is creativity in mathematics clearly has not tried to write proofs. Finding a way to convince the world that a particular statement is necessarily true is a mighty undertaking and can often be quite challenging. There is no guaranteed path to success in the search for proofs. For example, in the summer of 1742, a German mathematician by the name of Christian Goldbach wondered whether every even integer greater than 2 could be written as the sum of two primes. Centuries later, we still don’t have a proof of this apparent fact (computers have checked that Goldbach’s conjecture holds for all numbers less than <span class="process-math">\(4\times 10^{18}\text{,}\)</span> but no proof that the statement holds for <em class="emphasis">all</em> numbers has been found).</div>
