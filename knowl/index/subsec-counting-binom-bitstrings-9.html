<div class="para">It is not surprising then that the same relationship between Pascalâ€™s triangle and lattice paths holds for bit strings.  Look at the 10 strings above.  The first row contains all the bit strings of <span class="process-math">\(\B^5_3\)</span> that end in a 0.  Before that ending 0, we have a string in <span class="process-math">\(\B^4_3\text{,}\)</span> since it must have length 4 and weight 3 (the ending 0 increases the length, but not the weight).  The second row contains all the bit strings of <span class="process-math">\(\B^5_3\)</span> that end in a 1.  Before that ending 1, we have a string in <span class="process-math">\(\B^4_2\text{,}\)</span> since it must have length 4 and weight 2 (the ending 1 increases the length and the weight).  So the number of 5-bit strings of weight 3 is the sum of the number of 4-bit strings of weight 3 and the number of 4-bit strings of weight 2.  In symbols:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
|\B^5_3| = |\B^4_3| + |\B^4_2|\text{.}
