<div class="para"> Before we start counting, a quick note about how we ask counting problems. Often counting problems here are  terms of how many ways something can happen. That is, there is some <dfn class="terminology">event</dfn> that can result in different <dfn class="terminology">outcomes</dfn>, and it is the different outcomes that are counted. Alternatively, we can take a less “active” view by asking for the number of elements in a set, such as the set of bit strings of a particular length and weight. But this could be rephrased as asking how many ways the event of selecting one of the elements in that set, for example, if you randomly select one of the bit strings, how many things can happen?</div>
