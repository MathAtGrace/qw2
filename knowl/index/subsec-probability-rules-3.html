<div class="para"> First, we often are interested in the probability that an event <em class="emphasis">does not</em> occur. We call this the <dfn class="terminology">complement</dfn> of the event. Remember, events are subsets of the sample space, and not being “in” the event means you are in the complement of that subset. Using the same notation we have for sets, the complement of an event <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> will be written <span class="process-math">\(\bar{E}\text{.}\)</span> Here is the relationship between the probability of an event and its complement.</div>
