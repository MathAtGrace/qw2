<div class="para"> Why would we care about these properties? It turns out that some groups of properties happen together frequently, and for such collections of properties, we can prove general results about the relations that satisfy them. So if we can prove that a given relation is <dfn class="terminology">reflexive</dfn>, <dfn class="terminology">symmetric</dfn>, and <dfn class="terminology">transitive</dfn> (whatever those mean), then we know the relation is an <dfn class="terminology">equivalence relation</dfn>, and therefore we know it has a bunch of other properties. A large portion of discrete mathematics is about studying particular types of relations. One of my favorites is a relation that gives us a graph.</div>
