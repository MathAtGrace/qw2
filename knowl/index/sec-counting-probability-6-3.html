<div class="para"> The famous probability problem, known as the Monty Hall problem, presents the following conundrum.  You are on the game show <em class="emphasis">Letâ€™s Make a Deal</em> and will win whatever is behind one of three doors you decide to open.  Behind one door is a car; behind the other two are goats.  You pick a door, but before opening it, the host (Monty Hall) reveals one of the other doors that has a goat behind it.  You then have the opportunity to switch doors.  Should you switch?  What is the probability of getting the car if you do?</div>
