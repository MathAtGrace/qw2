<div class="para">First we will find the probability directly from the definition.  The sample space consists of all pairs of outcomes from the die and the coin, so <span class="process-math">\(S = \{(1,H), (1,T), (2,H), (2,T), (3,H), (3,T), (4,H), (4,T), (5,H), (5,T), (6,H), (6,T)\}\text{.}\)</span>  Without listing these, we could have calculated the size of the sample space using the product principle: <span class="process-math">\(\card{S} = 6\cdot 2 = 12\text{.}\)</span>  The event we are interested in is the set of outcomes <span class="process-math">\(E = \{(2,H), (4,H), (6,H)\}\text{.}\)</span>  Obviously that is size <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> which we could have also found as <span class="process-math">\(3 \cdot 1\text{.}\)</span>  So the probability of this event is <span class="process-math">\(P(E) = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Now consider the two events separately.  Say <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is rolling an even number, and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> flipping the coin and getting heads. The probability of of the first event is <span class="process-math">\(P(A) = \frac{3}{6}\text{.}\)</span>  The probability of the second event is <span class="process-math">\(P(B) = \frac{1}{2}\text{.}\)</span>  It appears like the correct way to combine these probabilities is to multiply them:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
P(E) = (A \text{ and } B) = P(A)P(B) = \frac{3}{6}\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}\text{.}
\end{equation*}

<div class="para">How convenient that multiplying fractions is done by multiplying the numerators and denominators separately, and this is the same as applying the product principle to the numerator and denominator of the fraction.</div>
